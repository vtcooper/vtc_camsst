These data have gone through bcgen and should be ready to use as sstice input data for CAM.

Note: lgmDAnorm*.nc~ has been copied and is same file as lgmnorm*.nc because
the 'DA' string was not included in the case builds when specifying SSTICEFILE.
Important thing to know is that lgmnorm*.nc is from the lgmDA dataset.
