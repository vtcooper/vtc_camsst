This main folder has files that are scratchwork prepping for CAM. 

I have used my prep_cam_bc.ipynb on UW atmos servers to do the
prediddle steps. Then I send those files to this folder, I adjust
them using prep_prediddle.ipynb one final time, then I plug
them into the bcgen utility. After that, they are placed in the
ready4cam folder.
