Vince Cooper Sep-2021:

I started porting bcgen over to python but didnt finish.
Here are notes on my personal hybrid python / bcgen way
to get boundary conditions from some arbitrary monthly 
mean data ready for CAM.

Trying to use bcgen myself on some data, and had success without using the “regridding” step
Step 1: take data and use my prep_cam_bc.iypnb (on sipn in p2c2/lgm folder) to get the data into the right grid / format for CAM
This is the pre-bcgen regridding step, done in python
Step 2:  use my prep_preddidle.ipynb on cheyenne to get the data ready for bcgen, which involves poaching some dates from other files
Step 3: copy that file or link it into /glade/work/vcooper/p2c2/vtc_camsst/ydong_bcgen/bcgen, maybe adjust ‘namelist’ according to clunky explanation, then run “./bcgen -i lgm_bc_final_prediddle_ready4bcgen.nc -c lgm_sstice_clim.nc -t lgm_sstice_ts.nc < namelist” to get your climo and ts files

That climo is ready for cam, I think.
I copy the files into: /glade/work/vcooper/p2c2/vtc_camsst/sstice_files/readyforCAM
after step 3.
