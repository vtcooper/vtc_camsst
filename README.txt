Vince Cooper notes:

example_inout has some files I fetched from Yue Dong's scripts / Cecile Hannay.

This shows what a file should look like, formatting and varnames etc, before you bcgen diddle it.

sstice_files has the inputs i have used and the outputs i have made for use in CAM.
I use the prep_prediddle.ipynb in this folder to get data formatted to plug into bcgen.

gamil_init is some github i forked to try to use its bcgen but it didnt work for me.

ydong_bcgen has the bcgen folder that I have working. README in there has my personal
steps to use bcgen. "active_bcgen" is a misnomer... i tried to work it there but should
really just delete it. caution to all.
